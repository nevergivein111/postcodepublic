For getting postcode details:


Initialize your configuration at app.config as
	'account' => "test",
        'password' => "test",

if you are using laravel 4 include Postcodes.php class in index.php as
	require_once '../postcodes/Postcodes.php';
if you are using any other franmework then include class at top.
	require_once '../postcodes/Postcodes.php';
	
Create instance of class "Postcodes" and call its 'getpostcodes' method. Pass postcode as an arguments.
